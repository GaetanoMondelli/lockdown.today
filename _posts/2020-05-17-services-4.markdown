#### Solitude server

Solitude clients allow you to perform some actions on a ethereum node.
In the config file you can specify how the client can reach the ethreum node (acting as a server) in the `Client.Endpoint`. 
You can also spin a testing ethereum server typing `solitude server`. It will run a Ganache node at the address specified in `Server.Host` and `Server.Port` of your `solitude.yaml`.
If your client is pointing to an already running etehreum node you can omit this configuration section. In many cases we want the solitude client to point to the same address we have run the solitude server.
