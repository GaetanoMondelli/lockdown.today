#### Solitude client 

The Solitude client object allows to communicate with an ethereum node client using web3 and rpc.
It is mainly used to produce contract objects and assist deployment on a blockchain instance.
For each created (or referred) contract, it stores ABI and optionally the bytecode.

Accounts are also managed by the client object by pushing a context.         Contexts can be nested and the account on the top of the context stack will
be used.

Deploy a contract is as easy as:

```python
with client.account(client.address(0)):
    client.deploy("ContractName", args=())
```

In the `solitude.yaml` configuration you can specify how to reach the ethreum client. For example in a testing context you might want to connect [Ganache](https://github.com/incerto-crypto/solitude) runs on the localhost at the 8545 port)  
You can also connect to a geth node however some of the clients configurations will not work.
